2021-06-14, FM: * moved to github https://github.com/euldulle/SigmaTheta
2020-10-26, FV: extension of AVarDOF, ADUncert and ADGraph to Hadamard and parabolic variances
2020-08-19, FV: implementation of errorbars and confidence intervals for PVAR
2020-03-17, FV: fixing a bug in bruiteur (works with very small amount of data)
2019-07-31, FV: * modification of Aver (options to change normalization coefficient)
                * implementation of GCUncert (computation of the confidence interval by using KLTG/KLTS method, see arXiv:1904.05849)
		* implementation of 3CorneredHat (from Groslambert Covariances -or classical Three-cornered hat- computation to graph display with confidence intervals)
