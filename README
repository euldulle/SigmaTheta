Examples of scripts
===================

1. STshell
   -------
STshell is an example of bourne shell chaining ADev and uncertainties for obtaining the same result as SigmaTheta.

Same input and output format as SigmaTheta. 

2. STshell2
   --------   
STshell2 is an example of bourne shell chaining ADev, Asymptote, Asym2Alpha, AVarDOF, ADUncert and ADGraph for obtaining the same result as SigmaTheta when the classical Allan variance is selected from the configuration file.

Configuration
=============
The configuration file ".SigmaTheta.conf" must be stored in the home directory. An example of configuration file is given in config-example/dot.SigmaTheta.conf. This file may be copied without the prefix 'dot' (cp config-example/dot.SigmaTheta.conf ~/..SigmaTheta.conf). Several options can be set or unset by typing ON or OFF after its description. The default configuration is ON for all options exept the Tau^-3/2 slope fit and the modified Allan variance:
68% bounds: ON
95% bounds: ON
Unbiased estimates: ON
Graph: ON
Title: ON
Fit: ON
Double Fit: ON
Asymptotes: ON
Tau^-3/2 slope: OFF
Tau^-1 slope: ON
Tau^-1/2 slope: ON
Tau^0 slope: ON
Tau^1/2 slope: ON
Tau^1 slope: ON
Modified Allan variance: OFF
Tau: 1 2 3 5
