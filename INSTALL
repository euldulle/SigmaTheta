Installation Instructions
=========================

SigmaTheta follows the standard GNU installation procedure. 

To compile SigmaTheta you will need the gnu gcc C-compiler, the GSL 
library (Gnu Scientific Library, see http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
as well as libfftw3.

gnuplot must also be installed on the computer in order to run 
SigmaTheta (see http://www.gnuplot.info/)

After unpacking the distribution the Makefiles will build 
the binaries using the make command,

  make

If you intend to place the binaries into the /usr/bin/ 
directory, tape as root:

  make install


Testing Procedure
=================

You can then test the main program by typing,

  SigmaTheta data/noisetest.ykt nt.adv

The following data should be printed on screen:

Moreover, 2 files should be created: nt.adv.gnu and nt.adv.ps. 
The first one is a gnuplot command file which should contain:

set terminal postscript landscape enhanced color solid "Helvetica" 18
set output "nt.adv.ps"
set logscale xy
set grid
set key left
set xrange[5.946e+00:5.511e+05]
set yrange[2.774e-14:1.250e-10]
set title "nt.adv"
set xlabel "Integration time {/Symbol t} [s]"
set ylabel "ADEV {/Symbol s}_y({/Symbol t})"
set line style 1 pt 2 lc 7 lw 3
set line style 2 pt 2 lc 7 lw 2
set line style 3 pt 6 lc 2 lw 3
set label "Sigma Theta 1.1" at 5.097e+05,3.306e-14 right font "Helvetica,10"
plot "nt.adv" using 1:2:4:7 title "95 % confidence interval" with yerrorbars ls 2 , "nt.adv" using 1:2:5:6 title "68 % confidence interval" with yerrorbars ls 1 , "nt.adv" using 1:3 title "unbiased estimates" with points ls 3, sqrt(2.174317e-25/x**2+9.832043e-26/x+2.319278e-27+1.501548e-30*x+3.418445e-35*x**2) notitle with line lt 1 lw 2, sqrt(2.174317e-25/x**2) title "4.7e-13 {/Symbol t}^{-1} " with line lt 2, sqrt(9.832043e-26/x) title "3.1e-13 {/Symbol t}^{-1/2}" with line lt 3, sqrt(2.319278e-27) title "4.8e-14      " with line lt 4, sqrt(1.501548e-30*x) title "1.2e-15 {/Symbol t}^{1/2} " with line lt 5, sqrt(3.418445e-35*x**2) title "5.8e-18 {/Symbol t}    " with line lt 6
exit

The second one is a postscript file which can be opened with ghostview. The graph should look as the reference one located in the file "reference.ps".

You may also test the equivalent bourne shell script by typing:

  ./STshell data/noisetest.ykt nt2.adv

and verify that the files nt.adv and nt2.adv are the same, as well as nt.adv.gnu and nt2.adv.gnu, and nt.adv.ps and nt2.adv.ps.

Finally, you may check the other bourne shell:

  ./STshell2 data/noisetest.ykt nt3.adv

and make sure that the files nt.adv and nt3.adv are the same, as well as nt.adv.gnu and nt3.adv.gnu, and nt.adv.ps and nt3.adv.ps.

If all these tests are positive, you can be sure that the SigmaTheta set is properly installed.

Another way of checking the installation is by generating a noise with bruiteur and computing its Allan deviation:

  bruiteur flicker < mk_flicker.rep
  SigmaTheta flicker.ykt flicker.adev

The file flicker.adev should look like:

# Tau       	 Adev       	 Adev unbiased	 2.5 % bound 	 16 % bound 	 84 % bound 	 97.5 % bound

3.200000e+01 	 1.194315e+00 	 1.198360e+00 	 1.072455e+00 	 1.130944e+00 	 1.269760e+00 	 1.347666e+00
6.400000e+01 	 1.185212e+00 	 1.193365e+00 	 1.020497e+00 	 1.098803e+00 	 1.295993e+00 	 1.413830e+00
1.280000e+02 	 1.130846e+00 	 1.146931e+00 	 9.189788e-01 	 1.018454e+00 	 1.291450e+00 	 1.470555e+00
2.560000e+02 	 1.075108e+00 	 1.107906e+00 	 8.065422e-01 	 9.307041e-01 	 1.318418e+00 	 1.612557e+00
5.120000e+02 	 1.004451e+00 	 1.075839e+00 	 6.729765e-01 	 8.236511e-01 	 1.403832e+00 	 1.968065e+00
1.024000e+03 	 6.686291e-01 	 8.040981e-01 	 3.787698e-01 	 5.095008e-01 	 1.263986e+00 	 2.493070e+00
2.048000e+03 	 8.967642e-01 	 1.692521e+00 	 4.000906e-01 	 6.382338e-01 	 4.441769e+00 	 2.861589e+01

Differences of a few percent are entirely normal since this is noise simulation. Viewing the postcript file flicker.adev.ps should reveal adev values following a horizontal asymptote around ~1.3.
